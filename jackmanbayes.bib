  abstract  = {A class of models indexed by two shape parameters is introduced, both to extend the scope of the standard logistic model to asymmetric probability curves and improve the fit in the noncentral probability regions. One-parameter subclasses can be used to examine symmetric or asymmetric deviations from the logistic model. The delta algorithm is adapted to obtain maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters. A review is made of other proposed generalizations. The standard linear logistic model is widely used for modeling the dependence of binary data on explanatory variables. Its success is due to its broad applicability, simplicity of form, and ease of interpretation. This model works well for many common applications; however, it assumes that the expected probability curve μ(η) is skew-symmetric about μ = 1/2 and that the shape of μ(η) is the cumulative distribution function of the logistic distribution. Symmetric data with a shallower or steeper slope of ascent may not be fitted well by this model, nor is there any provision for treating the two tails of the estimated curve μ(η) asymmetrically or fitting different distributions for μ(η). This article introduces a class of models, indexed by one or two shape parameters, that encompasses a wider range of situations than the standard logistic model (although the standard model is included). The shape parameters have been specifically designed to modify the behavior of the curve in the extreme-probability regions where problems of lack of fit may occur, while allowing for asymmetric treatment of the two tails. Members of this family approximate the Gaussian, Laplace, and extreme minimum and maximum distributions up to the first four moments. The model can be collapsed to several simpler one-parameter symmetric and asymmetric formulations.},

They argue that ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression is inappropriate when the dependent variable measures the share of the vote going to each party, and they recommend a superior technique. Regrettably, the Katz—King model requires a high level of statistical expertise and is computationally demanding for more than three political parties. We offer a sophisticated yet convenient alternative that involves seemingly unrelated regression (SUR). SUR is nearly as easy to use as OLS yet performs as well as the Katz—King model in predicting the distribution of votes and the composition of parliament. Moreover, it scales easily to an arbitrarily large number of parties. The model has been incorporated into Clarify, a statistical suite that is available free on the Internet.},

A variety of independence hypotheses are introduced and interrelated, and new classes of transformed-normal distributions in the simplex are provided as models within which the independence hypotheses can be tested through standard theory of parametric hypothesis testing. The new concepts and statistical methodology are illustrated by a number of applications.},

  abstract  = {Bayesian simulation is increasingly exploited in the social sciences for estimation and inference of model parameters. But an especially useful (if often overlooked) feature of Bayesian simulation is that it can be used to estimate any function of model parameters, including "auxiliary" quantities such as goodness-of-fit statistics, predicted values, and residuals. Bayesian simulation treats these quantities as if they were missing data, sampling from their implied posterior densities. Exploiting this principle also lets researchers estimate models via Bayesian simulation where maximum-likelihood estimation would be intractable. Bayesian simulation thus provides a unified solution for quantitative social science. I elaborate these ideas in a variety of contexts: these include generalized linear models for binary responses using data on bill cosponsorship recently reanalyzed in Political Analysis, item—response models for the measurement of respondent's levels of political information in public opinion surveys, the estimation and analysis of legislators' ideal points from roll-call data, and outlier-resistant regression estimates of incumbency advantage in U.S. Congressional elections.},

  abstract  = {Vote-specific parameters are often by-products of roll call analysis, the primary goal being the measurement of legislators' ideal points. But these vote-specific parameters are more important in higher-dimensional settings: prior restrictions on vote parameters help identify the model, and researchers often have prior beliefs about the nature of the dimensions underlying the proposal space. Bayesian methods provide a straightforward and rigorous way for incorporating these prior beliefs into roll call analysis. I demonstrate this by exploiting the close connections among roll call analysis, item—response models, and "full-information" factor analysis. Vote-specific discrimination parameters are equivalent to factor loadings, and as in factor analysis, they (1) enable researchers to discern the substantive content of the recovered dimensions, (2) can be used for assessing dimensionality and model checking, and (3) are an obvious vehicle for introducing and testing researchers' prior beliefs about the dimensions. Bayesian simulation facilitates these uses of discrimination parameters, by simplifying estimation and inference for the massive number of parameters generated by roll call analysis.},

Their propensity to do so, however, is constrained by their desire for reelection. We argue that the ability of governments to further their partisan interests and preside over reelectable macroeconomic outcomes simultaneously is dependent on the organization of the domestic economy, particularly the labor movement. We hypothesize that there are two different paths to desirable macroeconomic performance. In countries with densely and centrally organized labor movements, leftist governments can promote economic growth and reduce inflation and unemployment. Conversely, in countries with weak labor movements, rightist governments can pursue their partisan-preferred macroeconomic strategies and achieve similarly beneficial macroeconomic outcomes. Performance will be poorer in other cases. These hypotheses are supported by analysis of pooled annual time series data for 16 advanced industrial democracies between 1967 and 1984.},
