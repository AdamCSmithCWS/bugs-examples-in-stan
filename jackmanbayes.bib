  abstract  = {The relationship between response probability and dosage in quantal response bioassay is modelled using a four parameter class. In addition to location and scale quantities the model includes two shape parameters that essentially index skewness and heaviness of tails of the dose-response curve. The class of models includes such special cases as the logistic, normal, extreme minimum value, extreme maximum value, double exponential, exponential and reflected exponential distribution functions. Score tests are derived for logistic and normal hypotheses and certain submodels are discussed for which the model fitting is computationally convenient. The data of Bliss [1935] illustrates the potential improvement over usual methods in the estimation of critical dose levels.},

  abstract  = {A class of models indexed by two shape parameters is introduced, both to extend the scope of the standard logistic model to asymmetric probability curves and improve the fit in the noncentral probability regions. One-parameter subclasses can be used to examine symmetric or asymmetric deviations from the logistic model. The delta algorithm is adapted to obtain maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters. A review is made of other proposed generalizations. The standard linear logistic model is widely used for modeling the dependence of binary data on explanatory variables. Its success is due to its broad applicability, simplicity of form, and ease of interpretation. This model works well for many common applications; however, it assumes that the expected probability curve μ(η) is skew-symmetric about μ = 1/2 and that the shape of μ(η) is the cumulative distribution function of the logistic distribution. Symmetric data with a shallower or steeper slope of ascent may not be fitted well by this model, nor is there any provision for treating the two tails of the estimated curve μ(η) asymmetrically or fitting different distributions for μ(η). This article introduces a class of models, indexed by one or two shape parameters, that encompasses a wider range of situations than the standard logistic model (although the standard model is included). The shape parameters have been specifically designed to modify the behavior of the curve in the extreme-probability regions where problems of lack of fit may occur, while allowing for asymmetric treatment of the two tails. Members of this family approximate the Gaussian, Laplace, and extreme minimum and maximum distributions up to the first four moments. The model can be collapsed to several simpler one-parameter symmetric and asymmetric formulations.},

  abstract  = {Katz and King have previously proposed a statistical model for multiparty election data. They argue that ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression is inappropriate when the dependent variable measures the share of the vote going to each party, and they recommend a superior technique. Regrettably, the Katz—King model requires a high level of statistical expertise and is computationally demanding for more than three political parties. We offer a sophisticated yet convenient alternative that involves seemingly unrelated regression (SUR). SUR is nearly as easy to use as OLS yet performs as well as the Katz—King model in predicting the distribution of votes and the composition of parliament. Moreover, it scales easily to an arbitrarily large number of parties. The model has been incorporated into Clarify, a statistical suite that is available free on the Internet.},

  abstract  = {The simplex plays an important role as sample space in many practical situations where compositional data, in the form of proportions of some whole, require interpretation. It is argued that the statistical analysis of such data has proved difficult because of a lack both of concepts of independence and of rich enough parametric classes of distributions in the simplex. A variety of independence hypotheses are introduced and interrelated, and new classes of transformed-normal distributions in the simplex are provided as models within which the independence hypotheses can be tested through standard theory of parametric hypothesis testing. The new concepts and statistical methodology are illustrated by a number of applications.},
