# Simon Jackman's Bayesian Examples in Stan

WinBUGS examples from Bayesian Examples from Simon Jackman's old webpage:
<http://jackman.stanford.edu/>.

The webpage is no longer active, so examples were recovered from [Wayback Machine](https://web-beta.archive.org/web/*/http://jackman.stanford.edu/*).

I have translated them from WinBUGS into Stan, and edited the code and text as
appropriate for Stan models.
