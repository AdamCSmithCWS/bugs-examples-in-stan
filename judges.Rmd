# Judges: estimating the ideological locations of Supreme Court justices {#judges}

This program implements an ideal-point model (similar to the
Legislators example), estimating both the locations of the justices on a latent ideological dimension, and two parameters specific to each case (corresponding to the item difficulty and item discrimination parameters of a two-parameter IRT model).  The data consist of the decisions of Justices Rehnquist,
Stevens, O'Connor, Scalia, Kennedy, Souter, Thomas, Ginsberg and Bryer, in that order, $i = 1, \dots , 9$. The decisions are coded 1 for votes with the majority, and 0 for votes against the majority, and NA for abstentions.  Truncated normal sampling is used to implement a probit model (with the observed data supplying upper and lower bounds on the truncation points; see the Turnout example).  Alternative specifications are presented below.
