Bayesian Examples from Bayesian Examples



WinBUGS examples from Bayesian Examples from Simon Jackman's old webpage:
[jackman.stanford.edu](http://jackman.stanford.edu/).

The webpage is no longer active, so examples were recovered from [WaybackMachine](https://web-beta.archive.org/web/*/http://jackman.stanford.edu/*).
