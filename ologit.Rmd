# Ordered Logistic and Probit Regression

```{r}

```

Consider a response $y_i \in \{1, \dots, K}$.
Suppose each obesrvation has response $x_i \in \mathbb{R}^D$ and a sequence of cutpoints $\gamma \in \mathbb{R}^{K - 1}$, which are sorted such that $\gamma_d < gamma_{d + 1}$.

$$
\begin{aligned}[t]
y_i &\sim \mathsf{Bernoulli}(\pi_i) ,
\{k \in 1, \dots, K: \gamma_k < \eta_i \leq \gamma_{k + 1} \} \\
\eta_i &= \alpha + x_i' \beta
\end{aligned}
$$
$\gamma_0 = -\infty$ and $\gamma_K = \infty$.
